My name is Nehal Kumar. I'm an data analyst, software engineer and data scientist. I'm originally from Bangalore, India, but I moved to Melbourne in 2016.
I love all foods, particularly Indian food. I'm repelled to almost all forms of cheese. I'm not allergic, I just hate the taste! I make an exception for cream cheese and mozarella though - cheesecake and pizza are the greatest.
